# EMLO4

Welcome to EMLO4

## Pre-Requisites
 
* One of the main pre-requisite of this course is you should know how to work with deep learning networks in PyTorch (training and inferencing), as our world will revolve around that. <be>
* Also, it's good to have experience working with Linux systems, but if not you'll definitely learn a lot on the way.<be>
* It is assumed you are comfortable with Git and GitHub. <br>
* You must finish the capstone project to be eligible for the course certification. <br>
* You need to maintain a 70% aggregate score to be eligible to take part in the CAPSTONE project <br>
